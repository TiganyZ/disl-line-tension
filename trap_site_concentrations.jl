""" This file combines the concentrations derived from the McClean
Isotherm and uses the trap sites defined such that there is a
consistent definition of total concentration across all dislocation
core positions, which do not change even when there is a different
number of interactions (sites) which interact with the core at any
given time


> Need to constrain total concentration. Can either use the easy core or hard core for reference configuration.

> We run into a problem with a different number of sites around a dislocation,

  || The /effective/ concentration of a particular site /decreases/, if the number of sites around the new core /increases/. ||

> How do we rectify this?

Process:
        > Defined sites at a given core position will have their concentration defined by the distance dependence from
        >>  get_concentration_distance_dependence_splines(C_nom, ρ, solute_int) from McClean Isotherm

        > Sum over all concentrations of sites which surround the core.

        > Use this sum to scale with different sites.
